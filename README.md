# Deep Learning with PyTorch — Practice Repository

This repository contains my hands-on implementation of deep learning concepts using PyTorch
Each script demonstrates a core concept of neural networks, training loops, and data handling in PyTorch.

(I’ll be adding datasets and notebooks later for easier experimentation.)

Would you like me to make it more technical (with installation and run commands like python CNN.py) or keep it clean and portfolio-friendly like above?
